# Excess_Mortality

Exploring excess mortality vs covid-19 reported deaths during pandemic.

## What is 'excess mortality'?
**Excess mortality** is a term used in epidemiology and public health that refers to the number of deaths from *all causes* during a crisis above and beyond what we would have expected to see under ‘normal’ conditions. [^1] In this example, we're curious how the number of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic compares to the number of deaths we'd expect if the pandemic hadn't happened — a vital quantity that can't be known but may be estimated in a variety of ways.

Excess mortality is a better indicator of the pandemic's overall impact on deaths than the confirmed COVID-19 death count. It includes not just confirmed deaths, but also deaths from COVID-19 that were not appropriately identified and reported, as well as deaths from other causes related to the general crisis situation.

## How is excess mortality calculated?

```
Excess Deaths = Reported Deaths - Expected Deaths
```
Excess mortality is defined as the difference between the reported number of deaths in a given week or month (depending on the country) in 2020–2021 and an estimate of the number of deaths that would have occurred if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred.

### Keep in mind the following points about excess mortality figures:

It's possible that the number of deaths listed may not reflect all of the deaths that occurred. For two reasons, this is the case:

- To begin with, not every country has the infrastructure or capacity to register and report all deaths. Nearly all deaths are recorded in wealthy nations with high-quality mortality reporting systems. However, undercounting of death is a severe problem in many low- and middle-income nations. According to the United Nations [^2] , only two-thirds of countries register at least 90% of all deaths in "normal" times, and other countries register fewer than 50% — or even less than 10% [^3] — of deaths. The real coverage during a pandemic could be substantially lower.
- Second, even in wealthy countries with high-quality mortality reporting systems, there are delays in death reporting that render mortality data provisional and incomplete weeks, months, and even years after a death occurs. The length of the delay varies depending on the country. The most current data points for some are clearly very incomplete and thus erroneous; we do not display these visibly incomplete data points.


## Hypothesis

Excess deaths is a metric that compares the number of deaths that occurred over a certain time period to the number of deaths predicted based on the same time period in previous years. It does, however, rely on complete death registration.

**Excess deaths provide a perspective of the entire loss of life directly caused by Covid-19.**

It also illustrates deaths caused indirectly by the pandemic due to things including overburdened health systems, dread of going to the hospital, and a slump in the economy.

It will also show us which countries, for political or other reasons, underreport genuine Covid-19 numbers.
